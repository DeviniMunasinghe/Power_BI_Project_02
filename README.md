Project Description: This project involves the creation of a comprehensive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI for a car dealership company. The primary goal is to design and develop a dynamic, interactive dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) related to car sales. This dashboard will provide real-time insights into sales performance, enabling data-driven decision-making and trend analysis.



Key Features of the Dashboard:

Sales Overview: Tracks Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales, Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales, Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales, and differences between YTD and Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) Sales.

Average Price Analysis: Monitors YTD Average Price, MTD Average Price, YOY Growth in Average Price, and differences between YTD and PTYD Average Prices.

Cars Sold Metrics: Displays YTD Cars Sold, MTD Cars Sold, YOY Growth in Cars Sold, and differences between YTD and PTYD Cars Sold.

Visualization Charts: Includes a line chart for YTD Sales Weekly Trend, pie charts for YTD Total Sales by Body Style and Color, a map chart for YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region, and grids for company-wise sales trends and detailed car sales information.
